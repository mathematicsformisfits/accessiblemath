        <p>What is Accessible Mathematics?</p>
        <p>Accessibility and Accessible Design are a wide net of principles and practices to build inclusive
          environments and make content readily available to all people. Accessible design benefits everyone, and it is
          inspired by people who use Assistive Technology (AT).
        </p>
        <p>Accessible Mathematics is the application of this to mathematics.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="problem_statement">
      <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Braille, Screen Readers, Human Narration, and Tactile Sign language are four approaches to convey written
          text to visually impaired readers. Conveying mathematics is more subtle, however, because mathematical
          statements have more grammatical rules. For example, consider the statement "the square root of X plus Y".
          This may be interpreted as either:
        <ol>
          <li>$\sqrt{x+y}$, meaning "the square root of the quantity (X + Y)"</li>
          <p>or</p>
          <li>$\sqrt{x} + y$, meaning "(the square root of X) + Y"</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, software translations of the two mathematical expressions will correctly convey the intended
          meaning. On the other hand, sometimes the same mathematical notation has entirely different meanings based on
          the context. For example, the notation $| \phantom{x} |$ can denote:
        <ol id="math_example">
          <li>The absolute value of a number: $|x|$</li>
          <li>The norm of a vector: $|\mathbf{x}|$</li>
          <li>The order of an element: $|x|$</li>
          <li>The cardinality of a set: $|X|$</li>
          <li>The determinant of a matrix: $|X|$</li>
        </ol>
        In situations like this, software tools need a more robust, context based semantic breakdown of mathematical
        expressions to properly translate them for users of assistive technology. Authoring such statements encourages
        extra clarity, which ultimately benefits everyone.
        </p>
        <p>HyperText Markup Language (<abbr>HTML</abbr>) is the worldwide, cross-platform,
          device-independent semantic based authoring standard. Math<abbr>ML</abbr> is the extension of
          <abbr>HTML</abbr>
          for authoring
          mathematics. Math<abbr>ML</abbr> is much more verbose than HTML and generally not coded by hand, making it
          tenuous for authoring research, textbooks, and other long-format mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>LaTeX is the worldwide standard markup language for authoring mathematics due to its concise, contextual
          syntax and huge library of extensions. But the LaTeX typesetting engine is designed for print, which strips
          away the contextual information needed for screen readers.</p>
        <p>Portable Document Format (<abbr>PDF</abbr>) is the universal open document standard for print adopted by the
          International Organization
          for Standardization (<abbr>ISO</abbr>). Tagged PDF is a version of PDF that incorporates a semantic structure
          similar to <abbr>HTML</abbr>, offering an ideal solution for accessible mathematics if math markup could
          be ported into the underlying semantics. This has not yet been standardized.</p>
        <p>Currently, a workflow for generating accessible mathematics content involves a hybrid approach between LaTeX
          and MathML. This process is described in stages throughout the rest of this document.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="sample_workflow">
      <h1>Sample Workflow</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Here is a high level sample workflow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write mathematics in a markup language.</li>
          <li>Include the math markup in an HTML document.</li>
          <li>Format the HTML to be structurally accessible.</li>
          <li>Test your document with a screen reader.</li>
          <li>Customize your math speech settings.</li>
          <li>Test your document with a refreshable braille display.</li>
          <li>Test your document on various mobile devices.</li>
          <li>Share your document with users.</li>
          <li>Update the HTML to address any accessibility issues from user feedback.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is an one sample workflow with specific software:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write your mathematics in a Markdown document using LaTeX delimiters and syntax.</li>
          <li>Convert the Markdown document to <abbr>HTML</abbr> with Pandoc, using the MathJax option to convert the
            LaTeX to Math<abbr>ML</abbr>.</li>
          <li>Test your document with VoiceOver (Mac), NVDA (Windows), and TalkBack (Android) in Firefox, Chrome, and
            Safari.</li>
          <li>Customize the math Speech Rule Engine in the MathJax script settings in your <abbr>HTML</abbr> document.
          </li>
          <li>Test your document with a refreshable braille display.</li>
          <li>Share the document on your web site.</li>
          <li>Test your <abbr>HTML</abbr> to ensure responsiveness and readability on a mobile device.</li>
          <li>Test screen readability on a mobile device with VoiceOver (iOS) or Talkback (Android).</li>
          <li>Update the <abbr>HTML</abbr> to address any accessibility issues from user feedback.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While this is considerably more work than typesetting mathematics for print, the process will produce a
          working template that can be reused and improved, just like a workflow for print.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="math_markup_languages">
      <h1>Math Markup Languages</h1>
      <article>
        <p>The majority of mathematics today is written in a markup language. The most widely used math markup languages are: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>LaTeX</li>
          <li>MathML</li>
          <li>AsciiMath</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Plain text can be used for mathematics, with limited functionality. This is discussed at the end of this
          section.</p>
        <p>The syntax of each markup language serves a dual purpose: to reference mathematical symbols and to determine
          the placement of the symbols. LaTeX was originally designed for print or presentation on a fixed canvas size.
          MathML and AsciiMath were originally designed for the web to accommodate a flexible canvas. An accessible math
          workflow today may use a blend of both.</p>
        <h2>LaTeX</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaTeX typesetting system</a> is the most popular
          method for typesetting mathematics. LaTeX was created in 1985 as an outgrowth of
          TeX, a markup language and layout engine created in 1978 to standardize typesetting mathematics and
          scientific formulas for print. For those familiar with HTML, LaTeX can loosely be thought of as as
          “<abbr>HTML</abbr> for paper”. It uses a context based syntax to signify chapters, sections, figures, lists,
          equations, self-referenced labeling, graphics, code snippets, and much more. The goal is for authors to focus
          on their content and let the LaTeX typesetting engine handle the presentation. LaTeX is extensible,
          open-source, regularly updated, and has a huge library of extended tools to serve literary, scientific, and
          artistic needs.</p>
        <p>LaTeX markup can be written in any text editor, but the LaTeX typesetting engine is required to render the
          mathematical output. This is discussed in the next section on <a href="#typesetting_software">Typesetting Software</a>.
        <h2>MathML</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathML</a> was created in 1998 as an extension of
          <abbr>HTML</abbr> specifically to render mathematics on the
          web. This provides all the benefits of reflowable text on any device, and a direct interface to mathematical
          expressions for search engines, learning management systems, assitive technology such as screen readers, and
          other web-based applications. There are two versions of MathML: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/chapter3.html#presm.intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presentation MathML</a>, which
          encodes information on how to display an equation, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/chapter4.html#contm.intro " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Content MathML</a>, which incorporates
          semantic information about the underlying mathematical expression itself. Please see this <a
            href="https://samdooley.github.io/mathml-docs/intent2cmml/demo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathML demonstration of
            the quadratic formula</a> to compare the difference.  Presentation MathML is primarily what is used today.
        </p>
        <p>MathML can also be written in any text editor, but is generally coded with <abbr>GUI</abbr> editors or
          conversion tools from LaTeX or other XML formats.</p>
        <h2>AsciiMath</h2>
        <p><a href="http://asciimath.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AsciiMath</a> is a math markup language for a small set of
          the most commonly used mathematical symbols. The
          syntax for a symbol is meant to mimic the symbol it represents, similar in spirit to emotive
          <abbr>ASCII</abbr> expressions that predate modern emoticons. It shares some similarity with basic LaTeX
          markup.
        </p>
        <h2>Plain Text</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/sets/mathematical-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unicode Character Set</a>
          contains a large collection of mathematical symbols that can be typed in plain
          text, without any special markup. This is only practical for very basic mathematical expressions, as it does
          not provide any additional formatting structure for fractions, matrices, and other special mathematical needs.
          Further, while the Unicode Character Set is updated periodically, it cannot immediately be amended to work
          with custom symbols. Still, it is worth mentioning because Unicode symbols will provide uniform semantic
          information to assistive technology across all platforms. This is the gold standard for accessibility.</p>

      <h1>Typesetting Software</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Any math markup can be written in any plain text editor, but a typesetting engine is needed to interpret the
          markup and render the resulting mathematics. Thus, most authors use an integrated development environment
          (<abbr>IDE</abbr>), a software suite that provides all the necessary functionality in one package. A few
          popular software tools are listed here, but there are many more available with their own unique features.</p>
        <h2>LaTeX</h2>
        <p>The LaTeX typesetting system includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The core typesetting engine</li>
          <li>A collection of add-on libraries</li>
          <li>A self-updating utility</li>
          <li>An editor</li>

LaTeX formulas are rendered as MathML objects in Word, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <h2>MathML</h2>
        <p> 
          MathML can be coded in any editor just like HTML.  Most authors prefer to use a <abbr>GUI</abbr> editor rather than code MathML directly.  To see why, please see the <a href="#code_examples">Code Examples</a> section for a comparison of MathML and LaTeX.</p>
        <p>Popular MathML <abbr>GUI</abbr> editors:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Wiris <a href="https://www.wiris.com/en/mathtype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathType</a> -- standalone, or as a plug-in to commercial word processing software such as <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-mathematical-symbols-91a4b04c-84a8-4de9-bd13-8609e14bed58" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Word</a></li>

            Research</li>
        </ol>
        <p><abbr>GUI</abbr> editors offer interactive menus and an instant preview of the output without the need to learn the underlying markup language.
        <!-- This may be more efficient for authoring documents with a small amount of mathematical content. -->
      </p>
        <p>Some limitations of this method:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><abbr>GUI</abbr> editors are not always accessible friendly.</li>
          <li><abbr>GUI</abbr> editors are not efficient for long-form mathematics.
          <li>MathML is not natively supported in all browsers (most notably, <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/5240822173794304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To remedy this last point, there are Javascript tools that will render MathML in any modern
          browser. This is discussed in the <a href="#web_display_engines">Web Display Engines</a> section.</p>
        <h2>AsciiMath</h2>
        <p>AsciiMath can be written with a text editor or any <abbr>HTML</abbr> authoring software. It is rendered in a
          web browsers with the MathJax display engine. Instructions are provided on the <a href="http://asciimath.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AsciiMath home
            page</a>.</p>
        <h2>GNU TeXmacs</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/welcome.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNU TeXmacs</a> is a typesetting system that uses its own internal markup for rendering mathematics and scientific expressions. It was created as an alternative to LaTeX, incorporating realtime rendering and a more standardized internal data structure that can export to several different output formats. It is free and extensible, and can also operate as a front end for a number of other powerful mathematical software packages.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there is no mention of accessibility support in the TeXmacs documentation. Further testing is needed to determine how
          its conversions to <abbr>HTML</abbr> and MathML react with screen readers.

        <p>
          LaTeX is widely adopted and efficient to code, but does not yet provide a navigable document structure to assistive technology. MathML provides this structure, but it is much longer to code and not supported in some browsers. To bridge this gap, there are JavaScript tools that convert LaTeX markup to MathML and display the MathML in a browser:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>MathJax</li>
          <li>KaTeX</li>
          <li>MathLive</li>
          <li>MathQuill</li>
          <li>Latex.css</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These tools aim to provide a "best of both worlds" approach, where assistive technology can navigate MathML just as easily as <abbr>HTML</abbr>, while the underlying LaTeX markup can be translated to screen reader and Braille output. Each varies in its scope, method of application, and accessibility support.
        </p>
        <h2>MathJax</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathJax</a> is the most popular method to render
          mathematics on the web. The MathJax engine searches an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document for mathematics markup
          embedded between LaTeX-style math mode delimiters (which are customizable), and renders it as math content on
          a web page. Users can customize the display formats (MathML fonts or <abbr>SVG</abbr> graphic), extract the
          math markup in both the LaTeX and MathML formats, and customize its math Speech Rule Engine
          (<abbr>SRE</abbr>). It integrates well with major content and learning management systems, and its excellent
          accessibility support makes it a key component of porting long-form mathematics into accessible friendly
          formats.</p>
        <h2>KaTeX</h2>
        <p><a href="https://katex.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KaTeX</a> is an engine that purports to render much faster than
          MathJax. This can provide a significant load time speedup for longer documents with a dense amount of LaTeX
          markup. Unfortunately, at this time, KaTeX has zero accessibility support, as assistive technology cannot read
          the MathML rendered by KaTeX. Therefore, it is <strong>not advisable</strong> to use KaTeX to port mathematics
          for non-sighted users.</p>
        <h2>MathLive</h2>
        <p><a href="https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathLive</a> is a component of the <a
            href="https://cortexjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cortex.js</a> family of web-based mathematical applications.
          MathLive accepts LaTeX input, offers a virtual keyboard with popular mathematical symbols, and offers a choice
          between its own built-in speech rules for screen reader math output or the same Speech Rule Engine
          (<abbr>SRE</abbr>) used in MathJax, both of which are customizable.</p>
        <h2>MathQuill</h2>
        <p><a href="http://mathquill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathQuill</a> offers an interactive web formula editor where
          users can enter text or LaTeX-style math markup and see it rendered into MathML in real-time. Users can also
          render static formulas in a web page through its coding interface. MathQuill does not appear to offer
          support for screen readers nor other assistive technology at this time.</p>
        <h2>LaTeX.css</h2>
        <p><a href="https://latex.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaTeX.css</a> is a very cleverly constructed
          <abbr>CSS</abbr> library that faithfully reproduces LaTeX-style formatting for numerous LaTeX environments,
          providing a more seamless transition for those coming from a LaTeX background. LaTeX.css is not its own
          JavaScript math display engine; rather, it uses MathJax to render mathematics formula, giving it a full
          set of accessibility features.

      <article>
        <p>Web display engines only read and render mathematics markup already contained in an <abbr>HTML</abbr>
          document.
          The HTML document must be configured to use a display engine through its <span
            class="inline-code">&lt;script&gt;</span>
          parameters, and most likely will require some <abbr>CSS</abbr> styling to accommodate different devices
          accessing the content.
          This contrasts with the LaTeX philosophy where an author should not have to worry about presentation and
          styling.</p>
        <p>Beyond this, one may need to convert entire documents containing a host of other content.
          An article written in LaTeX, for example, may contain:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Inline mathematics</li>
          <li>Block display mathematics</li>
          <li>Abstract</li>
          <li>Table of Contents</li>
          <li>Document Sections</li>
          <li>Tables</li>
          <li>Special formatting for content blocks such as theorems, lemmas, and definitions.</li>
          <li>Numbered or bulleted lists</li>
          <li>Images</li>
          <li>Figures</li>
          <li>Code Blocks</li>
          <li>Footnotes</li>
          <li>Automatic numbering for any of the above</li>
          <li>Bibliography</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As many of these elements are also native to <abbr>HTML</abbr>, a direct conversion is theoretically
          <em>possible</em>, but quite difficult in practice.
        </p>
        <p>There are several document conversion tools to assist with this part of the process. Each has their own
          strengths, and each conversion will require some additional testing for responsiveness across devices and
          accessibility support. The tools discussed here are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Markdown</li>
          <li>Pandoc</li>
          <li>TeX4ht</li>
          <li>LaTeXML</li>
          <li>LaTeX.js</li>
          <li>LaTeX2HTML</li>
          <li>sTeX</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Markdown</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown</a> is not so much a
          conversion <em>tool</em> as it is a markup language itself that is meant to <em>be converted</em> into
          <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Markdown is a bridge between plain text and <abbr>HTML</abbr>, designed for fast authoring
          but still readable as plain text. Markdown uses syntax such as <span class="inline-code">*emphasis
            text*</span> to represent <em>emphasis text</em> and <span class="inline-code">**strong**</span> to
          represent <strong>strong text</strong>. It is an ideal option for authors that want to minimize the amount of
          additional coding needed to render their work.
        </p>
        <p>Markdown can be written in any text editor, but requires a Markdown reader to render its output. Many
          browsers, collaborative workspaces, and online forums can automatically
          read and render Markdown. Markdown has also been expanded and customized within different
          document editing software. See, for example, the entry on <a href="#r_markdown">R Markdown</a> below.</p>
        <p>LaTeX markup can be included in a Markdown document by enclosing the LaTeX code between math mode delimiters,
          just as in an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document. Then, the entire Markdown document can be converted to
          <abbr>HTML</abbr> by a popular tool called Pandoc. This process is described below.  Sample code is provided in the <a href="#code_examples">Code Examples</a> section.
        </p>

        <h2>Pandoc</h2>
        <p><a href="https://pandoc.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandoc</a> is an extremely powerful "universal
          document converter" capable of parsing and converting between hundreds of file formats. It is run from a
          command line interface (<abbr>CLI</abbr>) by specifying the to- and from- formats along with any special
          options available to those formats.  An example is provided in the <a href="#pandoc_example">Code Examples</a> section.</p>  
        <p>Pandoc can call MathJax (or another engine) to render mathematics when it converts a document
          to <abbr>HTML</abbr>. The resulting <abbr>HTML</abbr> file will have MathJax automatically set up in the <span
            class="inline-code">script</span> section, and can work as a template for future use.</p>
        <p>Pandoc can also convert directly from a LaTeX source file, but content
          such as figures, tables, section headers, and other structured LaTeX syntax might not translate
          as well into HTML. The recommended approach is to write the document in Markdown and
          enclose mathematics between math mode delimiters. Pandoc uses its own expanded version of Markdown
          (called <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandoc Markdown</a>)
          with its own syntax for this extra structure.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to read about the many capabilities of Pandoc at the <a href="https://pandoc.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandoc home page</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="tex4ht">TeX4ht</h2>
        <p><a href="https://tug.org/tex4ht/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TeX4ht</a> was developed in 2004 to convert directly from
          TeX source files to <abbr>HTML</abbr> and several other formats. It is now included as part of the TeXLive and
          MikTeX distributions. It incorporates MathJax (and other methods) for mathematics output, includes the ability
          to add some custom <abbr>CSS</abbr> to the final <abbr>HTML</abbr> output, can convert documents written with
          <a href="#r_markdown">R Markdown</a> and <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overleaf</a>, and has other unique features.</p>
        <p>The article <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202301/rnoti-p68.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making Accessible Documents Using LaTeX</a> by Eric Larson and Isabel Vogt shows an example of how to use TeX4ht.</p>

        <h2>LaTeXML</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</a> was developed to convert LaTeX markup to an
          internal <abbr>XML</abbr> format specifically for the <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Library of Mathematical Functions</a> (<abbr>DLMF</abbr>) project at the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (<abbr>NIST</abbr>). In turn, the
          internal <abbr>XML</abbr> can be used to export to <abbr>HTML</abbr>, with various customizable settings. 
          LaTeXML offers a <a href="https://latexml.mathweb.org/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sample web editor</a> that converts user input to rendered <abbr>HTML</abbr>, with numerous built-in examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          LaTeXML was recently used to convert the  <a href="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv research library to HTML</a>.  This is an exciting development that could boost accessibility adoption for mathematics and science research everywhere.
        </p>
        <h2>LaTeX.js</h2>
        <p><a href="https://latex.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaTeX.js</a> is an interesting engine that ports full LaTeX
          documents into <abbr>HTML</abbr> while also reproducing their original LaTeX style formatting, similar to
          LaTeX.css. The web site showcases a side by side comparison of a sample LaTeX document to the rendered
          <abbr>HTML</abbr>. The engine is extensible and the project aims to automate translation of more native LaTeX
          environments. LaTeX.js uses the KaTeX engine to render mathematical formulas, and thus does not have
          accessibility support at this time.
        </p>
        <h2>LaTeX2HTML</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.latex2html.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaTeX2HTML</a> was way ahead of the curve, dating back
          to 1999. It is a command line tool that converts a LaTeX document into several <abbr>HTML</abbr> files to
          provide
          a paginated navigation similar to the original LaTeX PDF output. It automatically generates necessary
          hyperlinks, recreates lists, and converts mathematics, tables, and figures as into images. While the process
          does not provide alt-text, an author can insert alt-text for all necessary components.</p>
        <h2>sTeX</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://kwarc.info/systems/sTeX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sTeX</a> is a set of LaTeX packages designed to embed semantic information in LaTeX generated output. sTeX can generate a PDF with some annotations and a (much richer) annotated HTML document using MathML with the <a href="#openmath">OpenMath</a> (or other user chosen) reference library. sTeX also offers a plug-in for LaTeXML.
        </p>
        <p>
           sTeX is under active development, and requires some additional manual set up to use. Please read the<a href="https://github.com/slatex/sTeX/tree/main/doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sTeX documentation</a> for detailed instructions and example content.

        <article>
        <p>
          Screen readers convey mathematics through alt-text descriptions of mathematical expressions.
          The alt-text description is at the heart of accessible mathematics. Like markup, it has a dual objective:
          convey how the mathematical expression is written (the presentation) and what it is meant to represent (the
          content).
        </p>
        <p>
          Alt-text can be provided by:
        <ol>
          <li>The author</li>

        </p>
        <p>
          Alt-text can appear in:
        <ol>
          <li>Plain text that references the mathematical expression</li>
          <li>The <span class="inline-code">alt</span> property in an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/68642955"

          The standardization of translation of mathematical expressions is a difficult issue. Mathematics is conveyed
          differently among different people, and there is no single ideal method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that in terms of user experience, a sighted reader can scan elements in a syntactic expression, compare
          them each against a text description, and then process the full semantic meaning. Screen reader users cannot
          yet
          navigate both in tandem. Providing the same synchronous behavior for screen reader users is tied to the issue
          of alt-text.

      <h1>Math Speech Engines</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          There are specialized speech engines for math that provide a more natural, context-based translation of math
          markup:
        <ol>
          <li id="speech_rule_engine"> Speech Rule Engine</li>
          <li>MathSpeak</li>
          <li>MathCAT</li>
        </ol>
        These engines do not replace the screen readers mentioned in the previous section. Rather, they interact with
        math elements to produce an
        alternative speech and Braille output than the default output of a general screen reader. They can also be
        customized around different spoken word conventions for math.
        </p>
        <h2>Speech Rule Engine</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://speechruleengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speech Rule Engine</a> (SRE) is a JavaScript based engine, originally part of the ChromeVox Screen Reader extension for the Chrome browser.  It has its own internal default semantic definitions for mathematical expressions, can generate speech translations from LaTeX or AsciiMath markup, has multiple modes of math speech output, and can translate into several languages and Nemeth Braille.  
          The SRE <a href="https://speech-rule-engine.github.io/semantic-tree-visualiser/visualise.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semantic tree visualizer</a> demonstrates how it parses mathematical markup, with speech customization options.  SRE comes bundled with MathJax, can run as a standalone application, and is configurable with several browsers.
        </p>
        <h2>MathSpeak</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.seewritehear.com/learn/mathspeak-and-mathspeak-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathSpeak</a>
          was developed by Abraham Nemeth, based on <a href="https://accessinghigherground.org/handouts2013/HTCTU%20Alt%20Format%20Manuals/Math%20Accommodations/07%20MATHSPEAK.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemeth Braille translation rules</a>.  It is maintained and available commercially through <a href="https://www.seewritehear.com/learn/mathspeak-and-mathspeak-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SeeWriteHear</a>, an accessibility services provider.
        </p>
        <h2>MathCAT</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://nsoiffer.github.io/MathCAT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathCAT</a> (Math Capable Assitive Technology) grew out of <a href="https://docs.wiris.com/en/mathplayer/start#using_mathplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathPlayer</a>, both developed to translate MathML into speech and Nemeth Braille.  (MathPlayer is no longer maintained, but its documentation is still available for legacy users).  MathCAT improves upon MathPlayer's output capabilities, and will make use of MathML's upcoming <span class="inline-code">intent</span> attribute to allow authors to better control speech output of MathML expressions.

      <h1>Math in Braille</h1>
      <article>
        <p>There are four standards for authoring and reading mathematics in Braille:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Nemeth Braille</li>
          <li>UEB</li>
          <li>GS8</li>
          <li>DotsPlus</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Hardware and software for reading and authoring Braille are briefly discussed at the end of this section.</p>
        <h2>Nemeth Braille</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://www.brailleauthority.org/mathscience/nemeth1972.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemeth Braille Code</a>
          was created in 1946 by Dr. Abraham Nemeth to represent mathematical expressions and scientific content that was not possible with the English Braille American Edition (<abbr>EBAE</abbr>) literary Braille system alone. Nemeth Braille uses a 6-dot Braille cell, the same as literary Braille, with a mix of its own unique symbols and standard EBAE. Nemeth expressions are embedded in literary Braille between special opening and closing symbols (called <em>Nemeth Indicators</em>) that inform the reader when a mathematical or scientific expression begins and ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nemeth Braille was officially adopted by the Braille Authority of North America (<abbr>BANA</abbr>) in 1952, last revised in 1972, and has been consistenly updated to represent modern mathematics, chemical equations, and other scientific disciplines.
        </p> 
        <p>
          More recently, <a href="http://www.dotlessbraille.org/nubs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Nemeth Uniform Braille System</a> (<abbr>NUBS</abbr>) was proposed to better unify Nemeth Braille with literary Braille.
        </p>
        <h2><abbr>UEB</abbr></h2>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.brailleauthority.org/ueb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unified English Braille</a>
          (<abbr>UEB</abbr>)
          is an overhaul of English Braille American Edition literary system to modernize and unify literary,
          mathematical, and scientific content under one standard, and improve translation
          between printed text and Braille. UEB was officially adopted by the Braille Authority of
          North America in 2012. UEB uses a different convention for mathematics than Nemeth Braille.
          Due to the ubiquity of Nemeth Braille, UEB was updated in 2015 to allow readers to
          use their preferred style for mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.aph.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Printing House</a> offers tutorials on <a href="https://nemeth.aphtech.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemeth</a> and <a href="https://uebmath.aphtech.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UEB Math</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>GS8</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120219024932/http://dots.physics.orst.edu/gs.html"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GS8</a> Braille is named after its two creators, physicist
          <a href="https://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/06/43/4/gardner.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Gardner</a>
          and mathematician Norberto Salinas. It was developed to directly mirror LaTeX markup with Braille
          symbols. It uses an 8-dot Braille cell to accommodate a large set of base symbols from which the
          many thousands of mathematical and scientific symbols available in LaTeX can be constructed.
          GS8 is not in wide use, but may be preferable to those authoring in LaTeX.
          dCode offers an online <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/gs8-braille-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GS8 encoder/decoder</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>DotsPlus</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.washington.edu/doit/what-dotsplus-braille" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DotsPlus</a> is a
          two-dimensional Braille system designed to be a tactile font that mimics a written symbol.  It was
          developed by John Gardner as a means for educators to present mathematics or other scientific content to blind users without having to learn Braille.
        </p>
        <h2>Tactile Graphs in Braille</h2>
        <p>
          Dr. Gardner also pioneered a method to <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/printer-makes-visual-aids-for-people-sight-problems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">display data and graphs with Braille</a>, and began a company, <a href="https://viewplus.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ViewPlus Technologies</a>, to provide the technology and services.

      <h1>Math in E-books</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          This section discusses e-book production software geared towards creating accessible-friendly
          mathematics and science e-books:
        <ol>
          <li>PreTeXt</li>
          <li>R Markdown</li>
          <li>Calibre</li>
          <li>DAISY</li>
        </ol>
          There may be a bit more of a learning curve to these programs than those mentioned in the <a href="#typesetting_software">Typesetting Software</a> section, but these programs significantly ease the entire e-book production process.
        </p>
        <h2>PreTeXt</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://pretextbook.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PreTeXt</a>, originally known as MathBook XML,
          is an outgrowth of the <a href="https://utmost.aimath.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Undergraduate Teaching
            in Mathematics with Open Software and Textbooks</a> (<abbr>UTMOST</abbr>) project through the
          <a href="http://aimath.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Institute for Mathematics</a>
          (<abbr>AIM</abbr>). It was originally designed to create freely available open-textbooks on the web, and 
          has grown into a full accessible-friendly document production system.
          </p>
          <p>PreTeXt is its own XML that
          can be exported to HTML, PDF, Jupyter Notebooks, Nemeth Braille (using MathJax), and other formats. For mathematics,
          PreTeXt uses a hybrid of MathML to indicate math mode, LaTeX syntax for mathematics markup, and MathJax for rendering. It can be written in any editor, and it is compiled from a command line interface. An authoring guide, sample files, and several free textbooks written with PreTeXt are all available on the <a href="https://pretextbook.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PreTeXt website</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="r_markdown">R Markdown</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R Markdown</a> is an extended version of Markdown that works with in tandem with the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R language</a> for 
          statistical computing.  R Markdown allows users to include and execute code from R and several other languages, and export to HTML, PDF, presentation slides, and (many) other formats from the same source. R Markdown can also be used to author articles and shorter documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://bookdown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bookdown</a> is package for the R language to compile and
          generate R Markdown documents into EPUB, MOBI, PDF, and an HTML navigable book format. It uses MathJax to render mathematics, and incorporates LaTeX functionality such as equation auto-numbering, labels and referencing, and theorems and other special environments. The bookdown website has numerous free books available created with bookdown, including guides on <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R Markdown</a>, the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bookdown package</a>, and the <a href="https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R language</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only can R Markdown produce a high quality accessible document, it is also a versatile
          <a href="https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/rmarkdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> accessible friendly authoring tool</a>. The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BrailleR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrailleR package</a> lets users code in R directly with Braille.
        </p>
        <h2>Calibre</h2>
        <p><a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calibre</a> is a popular open source,
          cross-platform e-book reader, management tool, and e-book authoring software. It uses
          MathJax to read LaTeX input and renders mathematics as SVG images. The online user manual
          has a <a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/typesetting_math.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sample HTML
            document</a> that can be used as a template for mathematics, as well as a sample EPUB
          file of the same content. It may be an easier entry point for LaTeX authors who are already
          familiar with HTML to get an ebook up and running without too much extra work.
        </p>
        <h2>DAISY</h2>
        <p><a href="https://daisy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAISY</a> (Digital Audiobased Information SYstem) is an international consortium
          that develops
          tools to create and publish accessible reading materials. DAISY helped create
          the EPUB standard, pioneered Digital Talking Books (DAISY 3), offers accessible book
          production software, and operates as a news, events, and networking source. Please see
          <a href="https://daisy.org/activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAISY Activities</a> page for a
          detailed list.
        </p>
        <p>The DAISY XML standard integrates MathML to display math, and provides the option to
          synchronize a recorded narration of the mathematical content with it.
          This has an advantage over screen readers as an author can best customize the audio
          description to meet readers' needs. Authoring information is available
          at <a href="https://daisy.org/activities/standards/daisy/mathml/mathml-in-daisy-specification/">DAISY MathML Specifications</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>E-Readers for Math</h2>
        <p>
          The EPUB e-book standard is based on HTML, and e-book readers are based on the same core engines as web browsers. The EPUB 3 standard supports MathML, but MathML does not have universal browser support. Therefore, the same concerns apply to rendering mathematics in e-books: MathML code may be used directly, but some publishers opt for SVG images with alt-text.  Readers must check with their specific software & device to determine what level of support they have for mathematics.
        </p>

          There are other independent efforts underway to provide Tagged PDF with a robust semantic

        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.tug.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TeX Users Group</a> (<abbr>TUG</abbr>) has been working to incorporate Tagged PDF functionality into LaTeX:

          This work is analagous to the efforts to render math in HTML documents. One major difference is text flow.
          HTML behaves as one long continuous document that conforms to the
          size and shape of the device upon which it is viewed. PDF flows text in discrete pages on a fixed canvas size.
          Martin Ruckert's <a href="https://www.tug.org/practicaltex2018/slides/ruckert.pdf">HINT Project</a> 
          modifies TeX to have the ability to reflow text like HTML.

        <h2>MathML</h2>
        <p><a href="https://movemen.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MathTools for InDesign</a> by MoveMen (not to be
          confused with the <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/mathtools?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mathtools package</a> for
          LaTeX) is a commercial plugin for Adobe InDesign that allows embedding of MathML into
          InDesign. <a href="https://www.axaio.com/doku.php/.en:news:2020-07-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MadeToTag</a> by Axaio
          Software is a commercial plugin that builds on MathTools to offer better Tagged PDF and Accessibility support
          by including the semantic structure of MathML, an improvement over images and alt-text.</p>
        <p>
          Another approach is <a href="https://www.princexml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince XML</a>, an HTML
          to PDF
          converter that can generate Tagged PDF, as explained in <a
            href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/2019/making-accessible-tagged-pdfs-with-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making

          demonstration
          of Prince XML's output, please see:

        </ul>
        This document suggests some support for MathML. Prince XML's official documentation does not yet mention it.

        <h2>AsciiMath</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.metanorma.org/author/approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metanorma</a> is an open-source XML
          authoring system based on the <a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoc</a> markup language. Similar to
          the Pandoc + Markdown workflow mentioned earlier, Asciidoc + Metanorma's internal XML can output a source file
          to several formats. Please see their article on <a

        <h2>Markdown</h2>
        <p>A Markdown file containing the LaTeX geometric series formula above:
          <code style="white-space: pre-line";> # Geometric Series
            
            $$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a r^{i-1} = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$$
          </code>
          Note the double <span class="inline-code">$$</span> delimiters around the math expression.  This will render the equation in display format.  For inline format, use a single <span class="inline-code">$</span> delimiter.  These delimiters are not used by default in MathJax.  Please see the sample <a href="#mathjax_configuration">MathJax Configuration</a> below.
        </p>
        <h2 id="pandoc_example">Pandoc</h2>

          This will convert a Markdown file named <span class="inline-code">source_filename.md</span> into an HTML file called <span class="inline-code">output_filename.html</span> that calls MathJax to display the LaTeX code as MathML. The HTML file contains the source LaTeX code:

        <h2>LaTeXML</h2>
        <p>
          LaTeXML works in two stages.  The first command:
          <code style="white-space: pre-line" ;> latexml source_filename.tex --dest=filename.xml</code>
          converts a source TeX file into an XML file.  The second command:          
          <code style="white-space: pre-line" ;> latexmlpost filename.xml --dest=output_filename.html</code>
          converts the XML file into an HTML file containing a MathML conversion of the original LaTeX markup.
        </p>
        <p>
          Browsers that do not support MathML will not display the MathML, so SVG output is also available.  LaTeXML will use the underlying LaTeX math markup in the <span class="inline-code">alttext</span> property.  Options and customization is explained in the <a href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/manual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaTeXML manual</a>.         
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, MathJax can be added to the HTML file to display the MathML in all browsers.
